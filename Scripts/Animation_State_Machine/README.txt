Two examples of a simple animation state machine.

If you are not familiar with the concept of a state machine, go search for it on google.
Once you grasp the concept, the scripts will be pretty self explanatory, although I'd advice to have a look at the comments in the "simple_wing_animation_state_machine.lua"
The B-Wing version is just a heavily expanded version of the simple wing animation state machine. The important part here is to always make sure to return into the T-pose state.
